      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>Voqi AI helps online coaches and consultants automate their client acquisition using custom‑built AI systems that qualify leads, book appointments, and spark real conversations — 24/7.</p>
      <p>Founded by Sterwart Edmond Matafu, a forward‑thinking entrepreneur passionate about automation and business growth, Voqi AI was born from a simple idea: every business deserves a tailored AI solution that actually fits how they operate.</p>
      <p>We don’t believe in one‑size‑fits‑all templates. Your brand, your voice, and your process are unique — and your AI should be too. That’s why we build personalized acquisition systems using advanced tools like VAPI and Make.com, integrated seamlessly into your existing workflows.</p>
      <p>From AI DM setters that speak your language, to smart appointment forms that qualify leads on autopilot, to voice agents that handle inbound calls with ease — every system we create is crafted around what you need to grow.</p>
      <p>You didn’t build your business to spend all day chasing leads. Let AI handle the heavy lifting — so you can focus on what you do best: delivering transformation.</p>
      <p><strong>Let’s build something custom that actually works.</strong></p>
